# GoLang Echo Server

## Tech Stack
- Language: GoLang

## What Is It?

The GoLang Echo Server is a simple program that acts as an "echo" server. It listens for incoming messages from clients and echoes those messages back to the clients. This type of server is often used for testing network communication or as a building block for more complex server applications.

### How It Works

1. The GoLang Echo Server listens for incoming connections on a specified network address and port.

2. When a client connects to the server, the server accepts the connection and starts listening for messages from the client.

3. Any message received from the client is immediately echoed back to the client.

4. The client can send multiple messages, and each one will be echoed back.

5. When the client disconnects, the server continues to listen for new connections.

### Use Cases

The GoLang Echo Server can be used for various purposes, including:

- Testing network communication and connectivity.
- Debugging and troubleshooting network applications.
- Educational purposes to understand socket programming and basic server-client interactions.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have GoLang installed on your system.

2. Clone or download the GoLang Echo Server code from this repository.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the server code.

4. Compile and run the server using the following commands:
```shell
   go build echoserver.go
   ./echoserver
```

1. The server will start listening for incoming connections on a default port (e.g., 8080).

2. You can use Telnet or a client program to connect to the server and send messages. The server will echo the messages back to you.

3. To stop the server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.
